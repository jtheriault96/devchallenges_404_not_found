## Overview

- Where can I see your demo? 
    My demo has been deployed on <a href="https://devchallenges-404-not-found-h48nsaaw0.vercel.app/">Vercel</a>

- What was your experience?
    As someone who primarily develops in Java and who's front end experience is usually limited to adding forms or buttons using components and styling that my coworkers have already built, structuring a front end project and actually writing my own CSS proved to be a bit of a challenge at first. By the end of the challenge I was feeling much more comfortable though, and I feel ready to take on the next one! 

- What have you learned/improved?
    This was my first time doing anything responsive, the product I work on is browser only, so I've actually never even seen a media query before. The mobile first mindset might take a bit of getting used to, but making the site responsive ended up being more straightforward than I had expected. This was also my first time deploying with Vercel, and I was pleased to learn that it's as easy as can be.

- Your wisdom? :)
    Develop for mobile first, and figure out the structure of your divs before adding CSS. Flexbox is useful because you can change the flex-direction in your media queries.
